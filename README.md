Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Proj1-HelloSquirrel** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø.  **It displays my name, bio, and 3 of my hobbies**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üòªü§ëüëæ**
